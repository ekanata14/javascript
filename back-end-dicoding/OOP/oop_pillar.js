/* 4 OOP Pillar

There are 4 pillars in OOP:
-Encapsulation
-Abstraction
-Inheritance
-Polymorphism

Encapsulation: Attribute and method can't be accessed directly when the object is instatiated and it's private. But it can be accessed from the method within the object
Abstraction: An object just shown its high-level operation. Means that user don't need to know how the method operation is encrypted or something else. They just need to know the method operation is running.
Inheritance: Some objects can have same attribute and method. It's because inheritance. Inheritance inherit them to object that is instatiated. But, the instantiated object can't access the instantiated object attribute or method, instantiated object just can access the parent method and attribute.
Polymorphism: Objects can have a lots of type and implementation, but they have one equal class. As example there is a class named Mail, and the objects are email, sms, whatsApp that is instantiated from class Mail. These three objects are different, but they have one equal class that is Mail class.
